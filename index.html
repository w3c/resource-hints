    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Modern browsers leverage a wide variety of speculative optimization techniques to anticipate user input and intent, which allows them to hide some of the networking, processing, and rendering latencies: preconnects, prefetching of resources, and prerendering of resources for subsequent navigation.</p>

    <p>The decision to initiate one or more of the above optimizations is typically based on heuristic rules based on document markup and structure, navigation history, and context of the user - e.g., type of device, available compute and memory resources, network connectivity, user preferences, and so on. These techniques have proven to be successful, but can be further improved by leveraging the knowledge a developer has about the front-end and back-end generation and delivery of the resources of a web application.</p>

    <p>For example, the application may provide the following resource hints to the user agent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The list of origins from which resources will be fetched.</li>
      <li>The next likely user action or navigation target, and the resources that will be required, based on current page or application state, individual user history, or aggregated session data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many web applications already leverage a variety of prefetching techniques. This includes, but is not limited to, using `XMLHttpRequest` to fetch and cache assets before they are needed. However, these implementations are application specific, are not interoperable, and do not provide the same level of performance as the browser-provided primitives. Worse, these implementations sometimes conflict with the browser logic and result in delayed or unnecessary resource fetches that degrade overall page performance.</p>

    <p>This specification defines the <a>dns-prefetch</a>, <a>preconnect</a>, <a>prefetch</a>, and <a>prerender</a> relationships of the HTML Link Element (`&lt;link>`). These primitives enable the developer, and the server generating or delivering the resources, to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch and preprocess to improve page performance.</p>

    <h2>Resource Hints</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A <dfn>resource hint link</dfn> is a <a>dns-prefetch</a>, <a>preconnect</a>, <a>prefetch</a>, or <a>prerender</a> relationship that is used to indicate an origin or resource that should be connected to, or fetched, by the user agent.</li>
      <li>A <dfn>speculative fetch</dfn> is a fetch initiated via a <a>prefetch</a> or <a>prerender</a> relationship.</li>
    </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>DNS Prefetch</h2>

      <p>The <code><dfn>dns-prefetch</dfn></code> link relation type is used to indicate an origin that will be used to fetch required resources, and that the user agent SHOULD resolve as early as possible.</p>

      <pre class="example html">
  &lt;link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//example.com"&gt;
      </pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Preconnect</h2>

      <p>The <code><dfn>preconnect</dfn></code> link relation type is used to indicate an origin that will be used to fetch required resources. Initiating an early connection, which includes the DNS lookup, TCP handshake, and optional TLS negotiation, allows the user agent to mask the high latency costs of establishing a connection.</p>

      <pre class="example html">
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//example.com"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//cdn.example.com" crossorigin&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>To <dfn>initiate a preconnect</dfn>, the user agent MUST run these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#resolve-a-url">Resolve</a> the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#url">URL</a> given by the `href` attribute.
        <ol>
        <li>If that is successful, let <var>preconnect URL</var> be the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#resulting-absolute-url">resulting absolute URL</a>, and otherwise abort these steps.</li>
        <li>If <var>preconnect URL</var>'s <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-scheme">scheme</a> is not one of "http" or "https" then abort these steps.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Let <var>origin</var> be <var>preconnect URL</var>'s <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-origin">origin</a>.</li>
        <li>Let <var>corsAttributeState</var> be the current state of the element's <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#cors-settings-attributes">`crossorigin`</a> content attribute.</li>
        <li>Let <var>credentials</var> be a boolean value set to `true`.
        <li>If <var>corsAttributeState</var> is `Anonymous` and <var>origin</var> is not equal to <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#origin-2">current Document's origin</a>, set <var>credentials</var> to `false`.</li>
        <li>Attempt to <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-connection-obtain">obtain connection</a> with <var>origin</var> and <var>credentials</var>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The user agent SHOULD attempt to <a>initiate a preconnect</a> and perform the full connection handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP, and DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins) whenever possible, but is allowed to elect to perform a partial handshake (DNS only for HTTP, and DNS or DNS+TCP for HTTPS origins), or skip it entirely, due to resource constraints or other reasons.</p>

      <p>The optimal number of connections per origin is dependent on the negotiated protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, global connection limits, and other context specific variables. As a result, the decision for how many connections should be opened is deferred to the user agent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Prefetch</h2>

      <p>The <code><dfn>prefetch</dfn></code> link relation type is used to identify a resource that might be required by the next navigation, and that the user agent SHOULD fetch, such that the user agent can deliver a faster response once the resource is requested in the future.</p>

      <pre class="example html">
  &lt;link rel="prefetch" href="//example.com/next-page.html" as="document" crossorigin="use-credentials"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="prefetch" href="/library.js" as="script"&gt;
      </pre>

      <ul>
        <li>The user agent SHOULD NOT apply preprocessing on the response and MUST NOT automatically execute or apply it against the current page context.</li>
        <li>The `as` attribute is an OPTIONAL attribute that must conform to requirements defined in [[PRELOAD]].</li>
        <li>The `crossorigin` <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#cors-settings-attributes">CORS setting attribute</a> is an OPTIONAL attribute that indicates the CORS policy of the specified resource.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        The `as` attribute can be used by the application to communicate the resource destination context, such that the user agent can optimize the fetching process - e.g. set appropriate request headers, transport priority, and so on.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Prerender</h2>

      <p>The <code><dfn>prerender</dfn></code> link relation type is used to identify a resource that might be required by the next navigation, and that the user agent SHOULD fetch and execute, such that the user agent can deliver a faster response once the resource is requested in the future.</p>

      <pre class="example html">
  &lt;link rel="prerender" href="//example.com/next-page.html"&gt;
      </pre>

      <p>The user agent MAY preprocess the HTML response by also fetching the necessary subresources and executing them (i.e. prerender the page). The decision for which prerendering steps are performed is deferred to the user agent. The user agent MAY:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Allocate fewer CPU, GPU, or memory resources to prerendered content.</li>
        <li>Delay some requests until the requested HTML resource is made visible - e.g. media downloads, plugin content, and so on.</li>
        <li>Prevent prerendering from being initiated when there are limited resources available.</li>
        <li>Abandon prerendering due to high cost or resource requirements - e.g. high CPU or memory usage, expensive data access, and so on.</li>
        <li>Abandon prerendering due to the type or properties of the fetched content:
        <ul>
          <li>If the target exhibits non-idempotent behavior: mutations to shared local storage, `XMLHttpRequest` with a verb other than GET, HEAD, or OPTION, and so on.</li>
          <li>If the target triggers a condition that requires user input: confirmation dialogs, authentication prompts, alerts, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The above processing strategies are not an exhaustive list. The user agent may implement other strategies.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When prerendering a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#document">document</a> the user agent MUST set the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#document">document</a>'s <a href="http://w3c.github.io/page-visibility/#visibilitystate-attribute">visibilityState</a> ([[!PAGE-VISIBILITY]]) value to `prerender`.</p>

      <div class="note">
        The <a>prerender</a> hint can be used by the application to indicate the next likely HTML navigation target: the user agent will fetch and process the specified resource as an HTML response. To fetch other content-types with appropriate request headers, or if HTML preprocessing is not desired, the application can use the <a>prefetch</a> hint.
      </div>

      <div class="note">
        To ensure compatibility and improve the success rate of prerendering requests the target page can use the Page Visibility API to determine the visibility state of the page as it is being rendered and implement appropriate logic to avoid actions that may cause the prerender to be abandoned (e.g. non-idempotent requests), or unwanted side-effects from being triggered (e.g. analytics beacons firing prior to the page being displayed).
      </div>

  <section>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>Fetching the resource hint link</h2>
      <p>The <a>resource hint link</a>'s may be specified in the document markup, MAY be provided via the HTTP `Link` header, and MAY be dynamically added to and removed from the document.</p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight nolinks">
  Link: &lt;https://widget.com&gt;; rel=dns-prefetch
  Link: &lt;https://example.com&gt;; rel=preconnect
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/next-page.html&gt;; rel=prerender;
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/logo-hires.jpg&gt;; rel=prefetch; as=image;
      </pre>

      <pre class="example js">
  &lt;link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//widget.com"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//cdn.example.com"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="prerender" href="//example.com/next-page.html"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="prefetch" href="//example.com/logo-hires.jpg" as="image"&gt;
      </pre>

      <pre class="example js">
  var hint = document.createElement("link");
  hint.rel = "prefetch";
  hint.as = "document";
  hint.href = "/article/part3.html";
  document.head.appendChild(hint);
      </pre>

      <p>The appropriate times to connect to a host, or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#concept-link-obtain">obtain</a> the specified resource are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>When the user agent that supports [[!RFC5988]] processes <a>resource hint link</a> specified via the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">Link HTTP header</a>.</li>
        <li>When the <a>resource hint link</a>'s `link` element is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#insert-an-element-into-a-document">inserted into a document</a>.</li>
        <li>When the <a>resource hint link</a> is created on a `link` element that is already <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#in-a-document">in a Document</a>.</li>
        <li>When the `href` attribute of the `link` element of an <a>resource hint link</a> that is already <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#in-a-document">in a Document</a> is changed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The user agent MAY delay the fetch of <a>speculative fetch</a> to minimize resource contention for the current navigation context.</p>

      <p>The decision to cancel a <code><a>preconnect</a></code> or <code><a>speculative fetch</a></code> is deferred to the user agent, which MAY use local context and other signals to determine if and when the optimization should be aborted:<p>

      <ul>
        <li>The user agent SHOULD abort the request if the `href` attribute on the `link` element of an <a>resource hint link</a> is removed, or its value is set to an empty string.</li>
        <li>The user agent SHOULD allow the requests initiated via the <a>resource hint link</a> to continue across navigations. However, the user agent MAY cancel these requests once it determines that they are not required by the new destination - see <a href="#reactive-resource-prefetching-prefetch"></a>.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Resource fetches that may be required for the next navigation can negatively impact the performance of the current navigation context due to additional contention for the CPU, GPU, memory, and network resources. To address this, the user agent SHOULD implement logic to reduce and eliminate such contention:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Resource fetches required for the next navigation SHOULD have lower relative priority and SHOULD NOT block or interfere with resource fetches required by the current navigation context.</li>

        <li>The optimal time to initiate a resource fetch required for the next navigation is dependent on the negotiated transport protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, and other context specific variables. The user agent is left to determine the optimal time at which to initiate the fetch - e.g. the user agent MAY decide to wait until all other downloads are finished, or MAY choose to pipeline requests with low priority if the negotiated protocol supports the necessary primitives. Alternatively, the user agent MAY opt-out from initiating the fetch due to resource constraints, user preferences, or other factors.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Load and error events</h2>

      <p>The user agent MUST NOT <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#delay-the-load-event">delay the `load` event</a> of the document due to outstanding <code><a>preconnect</a></code> or <code><a>speculative fetch</a></code> initiated requests.</p>

      <p>The decision on whether a resource hint is executed, and if so, whether full or partial processing is applied is deferred to the user agent. As a result, element-level `load` and `error` JavaScripts events are not guaranteed to fire, and if they do, do not guarantee that full processing was applied. However, the user agent SHOULD fire the appropriate `load` and `error` events when possible, to allow the application to track which hints were executed and when.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Use cases</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Dynamic request URL (preconnect)</h2>
      <p>The full resource URL may not be known until the page is being constructed by the user agent - e.g. conditional loading logic, UA adaptation, etc. However, the origin from which one or more of these resources will be fetched is often known ahead of time by the developer or the server generating the response. In such cases, a <a data-lt="preconnect">preconnect hint</a> can be used to initiate an early connection handshake such that when the resource URL is determined, the user agent can dispatch the request without first blocking on connection negotiation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Anonymizing redirect (preconnect)</h2>
      <p>Many sites rely on redirect services for analytics, malware protection, and to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/protecting-privacy-with-referrers/392382738919">anonymize the referrer</a> before sending the user to the final destination. Because the destination is known ahead of time, a <a data-lt="preconnect">preconnect hint</a> can be used to initiate the connection handshake with the destination origin (without revealing any private information) in parallel with the processing of the redirect - this masks the redirect latency and reduces navigation time to final destination.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Speculative resource prefetching (prefetch)</h2>
      <p>The <a>prefetch</a> hint can be used to implement a prefetch strategy that leverages app-specific knowledge about the next navigation based on content, structure, analytics, or other signals - e.g. high-likelihood search results, paginated content or step-driven flows, aggregated analytics or per-user behavior, and so on.</p>

      <p>For example, an image gallery may have knowledge about the likelihood of the next photo or page that may be requested by the user. To provide an improved experience the application can ask the user agent to begin fetching required resources (individual photos, critical resources, or the full page) before the next navigation is triggered.</p>

      <p>To achieve the above behavior the application can specify one or more <a>prefetch</a> relations of each resource being used.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reactive resource prefetching (prefetch)</h2>
      <p>The <a>prefetch</a> can be used to implement a "reactive prefetch strategy" that leverages the knowledge of where the user is heading next and enables the application to begin prefetching critical resources in parallel with the navigation request.</p>

      <p>To achieve the above behavior the application can listen for click, or other user and application generated events, and dynamically insert relevant <a>prefetch</a> relations for critical resources required by the next navigation. In turn, the user agent can fetch the hinted resources in parallel with the navigation request, making the critical resources available sooner.</p>

      <p>The enabling feature of this strategy is that requests initiated via <a>prefetch</a> relation may be allowed to persist across navigations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Prerendering (prerender)</h2>
      <p>The <a>prerender</a> hint can be used to prerender the destination page, enabling an instant navigation experience once the user triggers the navigation.</p>

      <p>To deliver an instant navigation experience the application can specify one or more <a>prerender</a> relations, each of which points to a destination page (an HTML resource). In turn, the user agent may fetch and process the HTML document, fetch its subresources, and perform other work to deliver an instant navigation - i.e. "prerender" the page.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>

    <p>The use of <a href="#dfn-resource-hint-link">resource hints</a> can provide new means to expose information about both the current page and user's activity on it. For example, observing the content of prefetched or prerendered resources, or observing the DNS, IP, and hostname information exposed during connection establishment, both for secure and plain-text connections, can reveal information about the page initiating such requests, and where dynamic resource hints are used, user's activity on it.</p>

    <p>To mitigate some of the above risks, the user agent MUST:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Treat <a>resource hint link</a>'s as <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-mixed-content/#category-optionally-blockable">Optionally-blockable Content</a>, as defined by [[!MIXED-CONTENT]].</li>
      <li>Apply relevant <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/CSP2/#complications">Processing Complications recommendations</a> for optimistic resource fetching, as defined by [[!CSP3]].</li>
      <li>Apply relevant Referrer policy restrictions for <a>resource hint link</a>'s, as defined by [[!REFERRER-POLICY]].</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additionally, the user agent MAY provide user setting to control the use of <a href="#dfn-resource-hint-link">resource hints</a>.</p>

    <p>The site author SHOULD take necessary precautions to specify the relevant [[!MIXED-CONTENT]], [[!CSP3]], and [[!REFERRER-POLICY]] policies to allow the user agent to register and apply them prior to processing a <a>resource hint link</a>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If <a>resource hint link</a> is provided via HTML markup, then the relevant `&lt;meta>` policies SHOULD be declared ahead of them - e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#delivery-html-meta-element">see `&lt;meta>` recommendations</a> for CSP.</li>
      <li>If <a>resource hint link</a> is provided via the `Link` HTTP response header, then the relevant policies should also be delivered as an HTTP response header - e.g. see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/content-security-policy/#complications">Processing Complications</a> for CSP.</li>
    </ul>
